      <h1 class="fw-bold text-center">Email-protocol</h1>
      <p class="fs-4">
        Email protocols are sets of rules that define how emails are sent,
        received, and managed between devices and servers. They include SMTP for
        sending, POP/IMAP for receiving, and secure versions for encrypted
        communication, ensuring emails move securely across the internet.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) :</h3>
          <p class="fs-4">
            SMTP is used for sending emails. It handles the outgoing mail and
            transfers messages from the sender's email client to the recipient's
            email server.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>POP (Post Office Protocol) :</h3>
          <p class="fs-4">
            POP allows an email client to retrieve messages from an email
            server. It downloads emails from the server to the user's device and
            typically deletes the messages from the server after downloading.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)</h3>
          <p class="fs-4">
            IMAP also allows an email client to retrieve messages from an email
            server. However, unlike POP, it keeps the messages stored on the
            server, allowing users to manage and synchronize their emails across
            multiple devices.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>SMTPS (SMTP Secure):</h3>
          <p class="fs-4">
            SMTPS is a secure version of SMTP that adds encryption to the SMTP
            communication, ensuring that the email content is encrypted during
            transmission between the email client and the email server.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>POP3S and IMAPS</h3>
          <p class="fs-4">
            Similar to SMTPS, POP3S and IMAPS are secure versions of POP and
            IMAP, respectively, which use encryption to secure the communication
            between email clients and servers.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="text-center">mailing list</h1>
      <p class="fs-4">
        A mailing list is a group of email addresses that allows sending
        messages or information to many people at once. People join to get
        updates or participate in discussions on specific topics.
