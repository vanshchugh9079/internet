    <p class="fs-5">
      A web browser is a software application used to access and navigate the
      World Wide Web (WWW). It allows users to view web pages, websites,
      multimedia content, and other online resources available on the internet.
      The primary function of a web browser is to interpret and render HTML
      (Hypertext Markup Language) documents

    <p class="fs-4">
      It involves copying files, documents, software, media, or any other
      digital content from a source (such as a website, server, or another
      device) to the storage or memory of the user's device. This transfer can
      occur through various methods, including internet browsers, dedicated
      download managers, or other software applications, allowing users to
      access and use the downloaded content offline on their device.
    </p>

    <h1>URL</h1>
    <p>
      A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference or address used to locate
      a resource on the internet. It is a string of characters that identifies a
      specific web resource and specifies how to access it
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      URLs are used to access various resources on the web, including web pages,
      images, files, APIs, and more. They are entered into web browsers to
      retrieve and display the desired content from web servers.
    </p>
    <h6 class="text-primary text-center">
      A URL typically consists of several components:
    </h6>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Scheme</h3>
        <p class="text-warning fs-4">
          Indicates the protocol used to access the resource (e.g., "http",
          "https", "ftp").
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Domain Name</h3>
        <p class="text-warning fs-4">
          Specifies the location of the resource, often the website's name
          (e.g., "example.com").
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Path:</h3>
        <p class="text-warning fs-4">
          pecifies the specific location or directory on the server where the
          resource is located ("/path/to/resource").

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Query Parameters</h3>
        <p class="text-warning fs-4">
          Optional parameters that provide additional information to the
          resource (e.g., "?id=123&category=articles").
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Fragment/Anchor</h3>
        <p class="text-warning fs-4">

        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h6 class="text-primary">
      For example, in the URL "https://www.example.com/path/to/page?id=123", the
      scheme is "https", the domain name is "www.example.com", the path is
      "/path/to/page", and there's a query parameter "id=123
    </h6>
    <h1>web server</h1>

        browsers or client applications by delivering the requested web content.
        The primary function of a web server is to store, process, and transmit
        web pages, files, images, videos, or other resources to users upon
        request.
      </p>
    </li>
    <h6 class="text-center">Key characteristics of web servers include:</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>

          Web servers are designed to deliver various types of content such as
          web pages, images, videos, and files to users upon request.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Protocol Support</h3>
        <p class="fs-4">
          They support communication protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
          Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for transmitting data between servers
          and clients (e.g., web browsers).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Request Handling</h3>
        <p class="fs-4">
          Web servers receive and process requests from clients, executing
          necessary actions to retrieve or generate the requested content.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Storage and Hosting</h3>
        <p class="fs-4">
          They store website files, scripts, and other resources, making them
          accessible to users through the internet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Security Features</h3>
        <p class="fs-4">

    </ul>
    <h1>FTP</h1>
    <p class="fs-4 text-danger"></p>
    <p class="text-danger fs-5">
      FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It's a standard network protocol
      used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer
      network, typically the internet. FTP is built on a client-server model
      architecture and operates on a pair of communication channels: a control
      channel (for sending commands) and a data channel (for transferring
      files).
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-center">feaute of FTP</h3>
    <ul class="ftp_char">
      <li>
        <h1>File Transfer</h1>
        <p>
          It facilitates the transfer of files from one computer to another over
          a TCP/IP-based network.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>Authentication</h1>
        <p>
          FTP requires users to provide a username and password to access files
          and directories on the server.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>Directory Listing</h1>
        <p>
          Users can list, navigate, upload, and download files and directories
          on the FTP server, subject to their access permissions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>Two Modes</h1>
        <p>
          FTP operates in two modes: Active mode, where the client establishes
          the data connection, and Passive mode, where the server establishes
          the data connection.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>Security</h1>
        <p>
          Traditional FTP doesn't encrypt data during transfer, potentially
          exposing sensitive information. Secure versions like FTPS (FTP Secure)
          or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) add encryption and enhanced
          security features.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>We Publishing</h1>
    <p class="fs-4">
      Web publishing refers to the process of creating, formatting, and making

    </p>
    <h1>space on host for web site</h1>
    <p class="fs-4">
      The "space on a host server for a website" is the storage provided by a
      web hosting company to store all the files, data, images, and content that
      make up a website. It's like renting a storage unit for your website's
      information so that people can access it online.
