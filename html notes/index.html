    <h1>defenation of element</h1>
    <p>
      In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), an "element" refers to a fundamental
      building block used to define the structure and content within a web page.
      An element consists of several components:
    </p>
     <ol>
       <li>
        <span>
        <h3>tag</h3>
          <p>Elements are defined by HTML tags enclosed in angle brackets ("<>"). Tags generally come in pairs: an opening tag ("<"tag">") and a closing tag ("<"/tag">"). For example, "<"p">" is the opening tag for a paragraph element, and (<"/p">) is the closing tag.</p>
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <span>
          <p> This is the information or text contained within the element. It's placed between the opening and closing tags</p>
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <h3>attribute</h3>
        <span>
          <p>Optional characteristics that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are placed within the opening tag and consist of a name and a value. They are used to configure or customize elements</p>
        </span>
       </li>
     </ol>
      <p class="ms-5">write a example after that attribute and content by program</p>
      <h1>cooment in html</h1>
      <p>In HTML, you can add comments to your code to provide explanations, notes, or descriptions that are not displayed in the web browser. Comments are useful for documenting your HTML structure, clarifying sections of code, or temporarily disabling specific lines of code.</p>
      <h5><"!-- This is a comment in HTML --"></h5>
      <h1>heading</h1>
      <p>
        In HTML, a heading is a text element that represents a title or a heading for a section of content. Headings are used to structure and organize the content of a web page hierarchically, providing visual cues to users about the importance and relationship of different sections.
        <br>
        <br>
        HTML provides six levels of headings, from <"h1> to <"h6>, where <"h1> is the most important and <"h6> is the least important. These elements are used as follows:
       <br>
       <br>
        <"h1>: Denotes the most important heading on the page.
        <"h2> to <"h6>: Represent decreasing levels of importance, with <"h6> being the least important.</p>
        <h1>div tag</h1>
        <p>
          In HTML, the <"div> tag is a fundamental element used to create a division or a container within a web page. The <"div> tag itself doesn't have any specific meaning or style by default. Instead, it's a block-level container used to group and structure content or sections of a webpage.</p>
        <h1>span tag</h1>
        <p> The &lt;span&gt; tag in HTML is like a small inline container that you can put around a piece of text or other content. It doesn't mean anything by itself, but it's really useful for applying styles, like changing the color or size of the text. It helps you make certain parts of your webpage look different without affecting the rest.</p>
        <H1>pre tag</H1>
        <P>
          The <"pre> tag in HTML stands for "preformatted text". It's used to display text in a fixed-width font exactly as it appears in the HTML code, preserving both spaces and line breaks.</P>
        <h1>paragraph tag</h1>
        <P>
          In HTML, the paragraph tag is represented by <"p>. It is used to define a paragraph of text on a web page.</P>
        <h1>formatting tag</h1>
        <p>1. Bold =The HTML &lt;b&gt;  is a physical tag, which is used to bold the text written between it.
        </p>

          <p>Example: <b>This is bold text</b></p>
          
          <p><"strong> Tag:The HTML &lt;strong&gt;  is a logical tag, which tells the browser that the text is important..</p>
          
          <p>Example: <strong>This is strongly emphasized text</strong></p>
          
          <p>2. Italic and Emphasized Text <"i> Tag:This is a physical tag which is used to make text italic.
               without extra importance .</p>
          
          <p>Example: <"i>This is italic text<"/i></p>
          
          <p><"em> Tag:.</p>
          
          <p>Example: <"em>This is emphasized text</"em></p>
          
          <p>3. Underline Text <"u> Tag: Used to underline text. Similar to <"b> and <"i>, it's more presentational and less recommended for use due to better styling options available in CSS.</p>
          
          <p>Example: <u>This is underlined text</u></p>
          
          <p>4. Strikethrough Text <"strike> Tag: Renders text with a strikethrough effect, indicating that the content has been removed or is no longer relevant.</p>
          
          <p>Example: <"strike>This text has strikethrough</"strike></p>
          
          <p>5. Superscript and Subscript <"sup> Tag: Displays text as superscript (above the normal line).</p>
          
          <p>Example: 10<"sup>th</"sup> renders as 10 <sup>th</sup></p>
          
          <p><"sub> Tag: Displays text as subscript (below the normal line).</p>
          
          <p>Example: H<"sub>2</"sub>O renders as H <sub>2O</sub></p>
          
          <p>6. Blockquote and Code <"blockquote> Tag: Used to denote block-level quoted content, often indented and styled differently from normal text.</p>
          
          <p>Example: <"blockquote>This is a blockquote</"blockquote></p>
          
          <p><"code> Tag: Represents a snippet of code. It's typically rendered in a monospace font.</p>
          
          <p>Example: <"code>&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;</"code></p>
